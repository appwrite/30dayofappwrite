[#30DaysOfAppwrite](https://30days.appwrite.io/) is a month long event focussed at giving developers a walkthrough of all of Appwrite's features, starting from the basics to more advanced features like Cloud Functions! Alongside, we will also be building a fully featured Medium Clone to demonstrate how these concepts can be applied when building a real world app. We also have some exciting prizes for developers who follow along with us!
